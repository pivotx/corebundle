Routing Component
=================

(as in Symfony's default Routing component)
'Routing associates a request with the code that will convert it to a response.'

This routing component is specialised in delivering various sites, browser 
targets and languages to specific controllers. Aiming to simplify routing for
common scenarios in modern websites.
It sports an 'internal referencing' system which allows developers and 
CMS-users can use to build simple links which are translated actual URL's. This
is similar to what Symfony users are already used too, but goes a lot further.

To do
-----

At this time it's not finished and the tests are far from complete. When it's
finished it should support more Symfony defaults:
- YAML and XML routes
- compiled routes
- routes to ReWrite rules
- more tests
- speed and more speed
