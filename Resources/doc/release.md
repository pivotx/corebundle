PivotX 4 Release Information
============================

This PivotX 4 release is very much a **PRE-ALPHA** release.

The purpose of this release is to get initial feedback from the community.
This release contains a backend which you can use to configure a new PivotX site.
The backend is still a work in progress, but it should give a lot of feedback how
a new site using PivotX 4 will be configured and how it can be used by content editors
and developers.


Code contract
-------------

We will try and keep the stuff that works now to keep on working in new releases but at this
pre-alpha stage we cannot fully commit to this yet.
Most Twig functions, filters, etc are not expected to change much anymore, but everything else
might still undergo some serious refactoring.


Release schedule
----------------

As of yet we have not defined a definite release schedule.
