<!-- 900 Beta Release

     Expected audience:    Designers and developers

Beta
====

At this time PivotX 4 is still in a beta-testing. The purpose of this release is to build an expection for developers
and provide some initial feedback for the project.

Every core feature we want is available in the CoreBundle, but might still require some refactoring and cleanup to be ready.
Some major things are still missing in the backend but will be there when released.
